# Data-Professional-Survey-Visualization-Project
This project entailed conducting a comprehensive survey to gather valuable insights on various parameters related to the field of data science. These parameters included professional challenges, preferred programming languages, satisfaction levels, and individuals' highest level of education during their transition into the field. After the survey was concluded, the data from over 600 participants was meticulously organized in an Excel spreadsheet. Leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, a robust data visualization tool, I transformed the data into visually compelling representations by utilizing key factors, thereby enhancing its appeal and accessibility.
