# Data-Professional-Survey-Visualization-Project
This project involved conducting a survey to gather insights into the professional challenges and satisfaction levels of individuals working in the field of data. Once the survey was completed, the data was organized in an Excel spreadsheet. Utilizing this spreadsheet, I created a visually appealing representation of the data using Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool. The entire project was guided by a YouTube channel called Alex The Analyst, which provided valuable instructions and guidance throughout the process.
